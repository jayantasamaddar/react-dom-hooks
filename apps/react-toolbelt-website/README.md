# Design Principles

- Built in mind with the possibility of going serverless and deploying to a CDN.
- Next.js is used to do serverside rendering and the need for a server is all
  the more especially during the build process, as the application generates MDX
  from Markdown files present in the packages (e.g. `@react-toolbelt/hooks`).
  But that still leaves for deploying the application as a Static Site to CDN.
