'@react-toolbelt/hooks': patch
---

- [x] Improved the performance of the `useResize` hook slightly. Further improvements possible: Using a ref was found working but due to failed tests, there was a rollback. Will update this in the next patch.
- [x] Exporting all types now that weren't previously being exported.
